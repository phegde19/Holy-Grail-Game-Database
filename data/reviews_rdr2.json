I should of played this as soon as it was released and to experience and complete this prequel to the original Red Dead Redemption game. Being a huge fan of this series, I have to say that Rockstar Games knocked this one out of the Wild West unlike before. I’ve heard many positive reviews about this and now I can see why. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a beautiful game. From it being an open-world, and making you feel as you're part of the posse. The storyline is well done, and quite strong as it is driven. The environment is well designed, and yet very vibrant when it comes to exploring, horseback riding, or just walking taking a look at everything around you. There is absolutely no mistake with this game. It’s perfect, and I can say it has a very strong replay value.",
